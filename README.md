## Prerequisites
* Python 3.8+
* Packages in requirements.txt
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Code
The notebook is structured in 4 main tasks:
* Task 1: Linear Regression with Non-Linear Basis Functions
* Task 2: Bias-Variance Tradeoff
* Task 3: Regularization with Cross-Validation
* Task 4: Effect of L1 and L2 on Loss

Launch the Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab from your terminal (or use PyCharm/VSCode) and click run, all the tests will start running automatically
